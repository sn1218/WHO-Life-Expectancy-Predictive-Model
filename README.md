# WHO Life Expectancy Predictive Model
## The Scenario

Your Data Analytics team has been tasked with producing a function that takes in relevant population statistics and makes a prediction on average life expectancy. The data has been provided by the WHO and it contains records between 2000 and 2015 across 183 countries.

One of the main focuses of this project is data integrity. Several countries have previously expressed concerns with sharing some of their sensitive data, such as medical records, as they brought about unwanted financial implications when correlated with their quality of life measurements and hindered social developments.

As such, your team has been tasked with constructing two models: One that uses the least information necessary to make a prediction, as well as a more elaborate one that can be used if states decide to share more sensitive data. Part of your task will be using your judgement as ethical data practitioners to determine which features may/should be used.

## The Project

The tools used in this project include: Python and Python libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, statsmodels, unittest).

The data is first split into training and testing data, and exploratory data analysis is conducted on the training data (see EDA.ipynb). 

The building of the linear regression model can be found in WHO_Lin_reg_function1.ipynb.

Function_Lin_Reg.ipynb contains the standalone interactive function.
